1 .General Information about the project:
1.1 Project Name: Ideation Portal


Project  Description :  Ideation is the creative process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an idea is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract. Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from innovation, to development, to actualization.  An ideation portal is a web project that allows users to propose, discuss, develop and review ideas.
Some of the processes within ideation portal design, implementation and maintenance include:
•	Creating database support for the ideas, user accounts and other information.
•	Designing easy to use user interfaces.
•	Setting up and maintaining a server to host the portal.
•	Setting up administrator accounts to manage the portal.

Users within the portal can communicate with each other through messages and notifications. Ideas can be modified or even deleted upon rejection. Users vote on ideas through a rating system .Feedback on ideas can also be provided to users in the form of a scorecard. Ideas can also be reviewed by a review panel before they enter the workflow mechanism.
